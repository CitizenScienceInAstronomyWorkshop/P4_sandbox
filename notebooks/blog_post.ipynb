So for a week now, its energy is slowly building up CO2 gas underneath the CO2 ice cover that is everywhere. I could bet that at some place with weak thin ice, already the first fans are popping up. Unfortunately, the light conditions at 2-4 PM, when our favorite camera HiRISE is flying over these places, are still so bad, that we have to wait a few more days until imaging becomes possible. But be assured we are hot on the heels to catch the action as early as possible.\n",
